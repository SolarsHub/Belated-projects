# Belated-projects

Here are the projects I was unable to hand in on time due to being sick.

The first project was the Minesweeper project.
Initially I was having a hard time conceptualising the project btu eventually I got my head around it. Deciding between the 1d and 2d array was the first thought I had on it but after getting sick and Aiden telling me that 2d would be easier it was what I stuck with.

I started with the basic logic of how the game starts and what happens when you pick the same spot/game over. Basically just the UI and how to play the game.

From there I moved onto the 2d array and getting the board set up through the board generation class.

I was going to put the bomb generation in it's own class but settled on leaving it in the same class as the board generation since it made sense. The previous mine generation class was left in but just left as an individual check on each cell.
